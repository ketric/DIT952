In State pattern a class behavior changes based on its state.
This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.

In State pattern, we create objects which represent various states
and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes.

HOW TO MAKE A STATE PATTERN:

We make a State interface defining an action and create classes implementing the State interface.
We create a Context class which carries a State and create a StatePatternDemo to use Context and State objects
to demonstrate change in Context behaviour based on type of state it is in.

PS. Our classes functions has the same name as the one in interface.
