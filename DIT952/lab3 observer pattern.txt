Why does he use the observer pattern?
The creator of the Tetris, we assume did this unintentionally because his project does not follow 
the MVC pattern at all. The observer pattern should normally be used for the MVC and since he didnt
follow the MVC, maybe he thought that in the future if he would like to add a new interface (Observer)
he would simply only need to make board (Observable) implement it.



When is the observer pattern used?
The board is the Observable in this case and the TickListener is the Observer meanwhile the 
NextShapeGui is the ConcreteObservable. So we found traces of the observer pattern being used 
when we saw that the Board had a list of TickListener and then has a method of adding the TickListener
and the method tick invokes TickListener in a loop. In the GameRunner we found that the NextShapeGui
implements the Ticklistener so that is how we interpreted it as the project having an observer pattern.
